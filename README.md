### Segmentation in Operating System
A process is divided into Segments. The chunks that a program is divided into which are not necessarily all of the exact sizes are called segments. Segmentation gives the user’s view of the process which paging does not provide. Here the user’s view is mapped to physical memory.<br>

### What is Segment Table?
It maps a two-dimensional Logical address into a one-dimensional Physical address.<br>

Base Address: It contains the starting physical address where the segments reside in memory.<br>
Segment Limit:  Also known as segment offset. It specifies the length of the segment. <br>
